### Base

Minimum control demo for base. Just command the base to rotate at 0.1 rad/s for 10 seconds while printing estimated odometry. In the end, deinitialize the base correctly. 

#### Usage

```bash
cargo run --bin base-advanced-control ws://172.18.23.92:8439
```

Remember to change the IP address to the actual IP address of the base.
